        <p>
            One of the most repeated breakfast in my home is aloo paratha. Everyone loves it. Piping-hot crisp wheat 
            flatbreads stuffed with spiced, faintly sour mashed potatoes stuffing and relished with some tangy sour 
            mango pickle. What is not to love about aloo paratha?

            The best part of making parathas is that you can serve them for breakfast as well pack them in the lunch box 
            for kids.Even after some hours, the aloo paratha tastes delicious.

            In Punjabi families, parathas are made with lots of love and affection. Most of the times parathas are roasted 
            with lots of ghee and then served with dollops of white butter or Makhan as we call them in Punjabi. However, 
            you can add less ghee and even roast the parathas with oil.

            ‘Aloo’ is the Hindi word for potatoes and ‘paratha’ means an unleavened stuffed flatbread. So aloo paratha 
            literally means potato-stuffed flatbreads or flatbread stuffed with potatoes.

    <strong>Step to make aloo paratha</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Boil potatoes just until fork tender without making them mushy. 
            To pressure cook in traditional cooker, cook for 3 to 4 whistles 
            depending on the size of potatoes. In instant pot I pressure 
            cooked for 5 mins since I used medium sized potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the potatoes boil, make the dough. Add flour,oil and salt to 
            a bowl. Pour half cup water and begin to mix to form a dough. Pour 
            more water as needed and make a soft yet non-sticky dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead it well until soft & pliable. If you press down the dough with 
            your finger, it should dent easily meaning it is soft enough. Cover 
            and rest until the filling is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the potatoesare done, cool them slightly and peel While
            still warm. Ensure your boiled potatoesare not mushy or soggy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grate or mash them will untill no bits of potatoes remain.
            Using your fingers break any chunks of potatoes left in the mash otherwise
            they will tear the parathas. Also do not over mash it as the potatoes will turn 
            pasty and sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Ginger, green chilies, coriander leaves, salt, red chilli
            powder, garam masala, coriander powder, kasuri methi, and chaat masala.
            Crush the kasuri methi before adding.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix all of the ingredients gently and taste test it. Add more
            salt or spices as per your taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll a dough ball in your ball in your palms to smooth. Lighty Sprinkle
            some flour or the rolling area. Flatten the dough ball and dip it in some 
            flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dust off the excess & roll it to a 4 inch disc or roti. Place
            a portion of aloo stuffing in the center. Gently bring the sides of the 
            roti up shading like a cup. Repeat the steps of pushing the stuffing inside
            with your finger and bringing tho dough up until the edges come over the stuffing.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the stuffing is sticky, dip your fingers in flour.
            Bring the edges together over the stuffing and join them 
            to seal carefully.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a pen or griddle to cook the aloo paratha. The griddle
            should be not enough otherwise the parathas will turn hard.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the pan is hot, gently transfer a rolled allo paratha to it. 
        </li>
        <li>
            With in 2 to 3 mins, you will see bubbles over it. Then flip
            it to the other side and cook.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will see the aloo paratha puffs and cooks well. Drizzle ghee
            or oil all over and flip it to the other side and cook.
        </li>
        <li>
            Smear some cook ghee on this side as well and press down
            the edges to ccok thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Soon you will see golden to light brown spots on the aloo
            parathas. Remove to plate and stack them. The keeps them soft.
        </li>
    </ol>
